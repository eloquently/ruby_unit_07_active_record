class ORMapper
    # We need a class variable and accessor methods to keep track of what table
    # we'll be accessing. By default, the table name will be based on the class
    # name. The convention is to have class names be singular nouns in
    # CamelCase and table names be plural nouns in snake_case
    # e.g. the SchoolDistrict class would map to the school_districts table

    # Use the pluralize and underscore methods from active_support/inflector to
    # convert.

    # Since users of your ORmapper class may want custom table names or
    # active_support may give the wrong pluralization of a word (see what
    # happens if you try to pluralize human or singularize harddrives), we will
    # also need to let users use a custom table_name.

    # This method will return the table_name class variable if its set.
    # Otherwise return the default table name (pluralized and snake_case version
    # of the class name)

    # default table name
    def self.table_name=(table_name)
        @table_name = table_name
    end

    # This method will return an array of columns in the table corresponding
    # to the object. It should work lazily -- that is, it shouldn't calculate
    # the columns until the method is called. Once it has been called, it should
    # store the columns in a class variable, and then if it's called in the
    # future it should return that class variable.

    # the column names should be symbols

    # Use the sqlite3 gem's execute2 method to get the column names.

    # since ::columns is a class method rather than an instance method,
    # if you want to refer to from inside an instance method, use
    # self.class.columns (same for table_name)

    # We want to be able to store data kept in the rows of our database in our
    # object. To do that we will create a hash called attributes. Attributes
    # will have a key/value pair for each column in the database. For a new
    # object, the values should all be nil, but the keys should all be present.

    # create an attributes getter method that will return the @attributes
    # instance variable if it exists. If it doesn't exist, it return create a
    # hash with a key for each column in the database, with nil for each value
    @attributes = nil
    def attributes
        @attributes ||= Hash[*self.class.columns.map { |c| [c, nil]}.flatten]
        return @attributes
    end

    # Now all we need is setter and getter methods for each column.
    # Think about the my_attr_accessor methods that you wrote earlier. The main
    # difference here is that these setters and getters will read/write the
    # attributes hash rather than instance variables
    # this will allow us to do things like:
    # school = School.new
    # school.attributes # => {id: nil, name: nil, min_grade: nil, max_grade: nil, next_school_id: nil}
    # school.name = "Tempe High"
    # school.attributes # => {id: nil, name: "Tempe High", min_grade: nil, max_grade: nil, next_school_id: nil}
    # school.name # => "Tempe High"

    def self.create_column_accessors
        self.columns.each do |col|
            define_method(col) do
                self.attributes[col]
            end
        end

        self.columns.each do |col|
            define_method("#{col}=") do |value|
                self.attributes[col] = value
            end
        end
    end

    # Instead of setting each attribute individually, it would be much easier to
    # do so with a hash when we construct a new object. Write a constructor
    # for the class that takes a hash, params, as the argument.
    # params will be a hash of key value pairs, where the keys are names of
    # columns and the values are the values for those columns.
    # You should avoid manipulating the @attributes hash directly here and
    # instead use the setter methods you created. (Use the Object#send method
    # we discussed during the lecture).
    #
    # It's possbile that some keys in params will not be columns in the table.
    # Therefore, you should only try to set a param if the key is in the
    # attributes hash.
    #
    # In order to make this class as flexible as possible, you should make it
    # work if the keys of params are symbols, strings, or integers (as the
    # sqlite3 gem returns). Hint: you should convert each key to a string and then
    # to a symbol when you check to see if it's in the attribute hash's keys.
    #
    # When calling the constructor to make a new object that is not in your
    # database, you should not give it an id. Let the database handle this
    # for you when you save the object (this will work out great if you use
    # autoincrement on your primary key when you create the table).
    def initialize(params={})
        params.each do |k,v|
            self.send("#{k.to_s}=", v) if self.attributes.keys.include? k.to_s.to_sym

    # It would be possible to do ORMapper.all.count, but this is not very
    # efficient, as it must load every item in the database into memory.

    # load the rest of the data.
    def self.count
        sql = <<-SQL

            COUNT(*)

    # We want a way to save new objects we create in ruby back to our database.
    # This method will run an insert statement against the database and return
    # true if it succeeds and false if it fails.
    # The insert statement should look something like this:

    # Then, when you call this method, you would use:

    #
    # Since this method needs to work more generallly, you will need lists
    # of column names and question marks that are based on the attributes hash
    #
    # Because we are using AUTOINCREMENT on our id columns we let the database
    # take care of assigning an id for us. If the insert is successful, we
    # should get the id from the database and save it to our attributes hash.
